## About it

Javascript project's are generally configurated with a bunch of other depencies to better build, test and deploy an application. This repository contains a group of very well community-backed modules that are generally use to develop NodeJS applications. It includes:

- Express for HTTP endpoints
- Mongoose for database
- Winston for logging
- dotenv for environment variables
- nodemon for relaunching the application on files changes
